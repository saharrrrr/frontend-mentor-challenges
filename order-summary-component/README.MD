What I learned

Working on this project helped me to reinforce my understanding of responsive design using Flexbox and CSS custom properties. I learned how to effectively structure a layout for different screen sizes using media queries. Here are some code snippets that I am proud of:

html

<h1>Order Summary</h1>

css

.container {
width: 580px;
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
flex-direction: column;
text-align: center;
margin: auto;
background-color: #fff;
border-radius: 15px;
}

js

const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}

Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

    Improving accessibility by using ARIA roles and attributes.
    Enhancing my understanding of CSS Grid and how to combine it with Flexbox for complex layouts.
    Experimenting with more advanced CSS features and animations.
